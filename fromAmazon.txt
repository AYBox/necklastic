Great product. Very smart and innovative. A great way to make sure shirts and shells don't lose its shape. I also use it for sleeves that can rise above my elbow. The ezlastic stays in, it is very good quality. The seller was also very nice, I lost the needle (it was totally my fault) and they are sending me another one!

I love this product! It is simple and fast to use. The instructions are clear. The needles are easy to hold and use. The elastic is very good quality, thin but strong. I had a lot of shells with stretched out necks and this kit was a big money saver. I bought one kit and then re-ordered more. Thank you.
Is this elastic flat like floss?
Answer: No, it's round. 
By Baltimore mother on March 23, 2017
its round like regular string, and it is rubbery that if you stretch it, it will not rip.

Question: Can this make necklines smaller, or just prevent stretching? If I want to make a neckline a bit smaller, will there be wrinkles?
Answer: Yes, it is used extensively to make necklines smaller & is a primary purpose of the product. It will not bunch (i.e. wrinkle) if you follow the instructions. The key is to make the 2 stitches, as per instructions. This allows the neckline to be pulled in mostly from the back so that the front is very smooth looking. â€¦ see more

It can do either one, depending on how tight you pull it. If you're making the neckline significantly smaller, there will be wrinkles, but if only a bit smaller, there should not be wrinkles.
