            Q: Is this elastic flat like floss?<br>
            A: No, it's round like regular string, and it is rubbery that if you stretch it, it will not rip.

            Q: Can this make necklines smaller, or just prevent stretching?<br>

            Q: If I want to make a neckline a bit smaller, will there be wrinkles?<br>
            A:  It will not bunch (i.e. wrinkle) if you follow the instructions. The key is to make the 2 stitches, as per instructions. This allows the neckline to be pulled in mostly from the back so that the front is very smooth looking.
